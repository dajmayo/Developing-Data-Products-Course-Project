# Developing-Data-Products-Course-Project

## Instructions
This peer assessed assignment has two parts. First, we will create a Shiny application and deploy it on Rstudio's servers. Second, we will use Slidify or Rstudio Presenter to prepare a reproducible pitch presentation about the application.

## Detailed instructions on creating the shiny app
* Write a shiny application with associated supporting documentation. The documentation should be thought of as whatever a user will need to get started using your application.
* Deploy the application on Rstudio's shiny server
* Share the application link by pasting it into the provided text box
* Share  server.R and ui.R code on github

## Detailed instructions on creating the reproducible pitch presentation
* It must be done in Slidify or Rstudio Presenter
* It must be 5 pages (including the title slide already)
* It must be hosted on github or Rpubs
* It must contain some embedded R code that gets run when slidifying the document
